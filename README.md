# Improving Land Cover Classificastion Using Genetic Programming for Feature Construction

This repository contains eight of the nine datasets used in the "Improving Land Cover Classificastion Using Genetic Programming for Feature Construction" paper.

[bibtex]

The eight datasets are divided in seven folders, one for each dataset (IM-3 is included in IM-10's folder).
In these folders, you can see a description of the satellite images and the reference paper for each dataset.

The Mz6 was not included in this repository since it belongs to the government of Mozambique and we do not have autorization to share the data.
